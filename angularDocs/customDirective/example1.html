<!-- Notice that we have bindings in this directive. After $compile compiles and links <div my-customer></div>, it will try to match directives on the element's children. This means you can compose directives of other directives. We'll see how to do that in an example below.

In the example above we in-lined the value of the template option, but this will become annoying as the size of your template grows.

Best Practice: Unless your template is very small, it's typically better to break it apart into its own HTML file and load it with the templateUrl option. -->
